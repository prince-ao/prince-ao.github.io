## Introduction

### Who is Pieter Levels?

I first came across Pieter Levels on hacker news where he discussed building multiple startups and emphasized rapid iteration.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üç∞ Only 4 out of 70+ projects I ever did made money and grew<br><br>üìâ &gt;95% of everything I ever did failed<br><br>üìà My hit rate is only about ~5%<br><br>üöÄ So...ship more <a href="https://t.co/oAn2rdRpFT">pic.twitter.com/oAn2rdRpFT</a></p>&mdash; @levelsio (@levelsio) <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1457315274466594817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Like most posts on hacker news, it quickly fell out of my radar. Fast forward to a few days ago, Lex Friedman interviewed him on his [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFtjKbXKqbg){:target="\_blank"}.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Pieter Levels is a nomad entrepreneur that focuses on building small projects quickly and monetizing them. This lifestyle has made him a multi-millionaire and very popular online.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Towards the end of the podcast the topic of deploying fast came up and Levels teased how he deploys so quickly. So in this article I will give complete guide on how to deploy like Pieter Levels.

### TL;DR

To deploy like Pieter Levels, create a webhook route on the server, register that webhook to Github to listen to push events and whenever a push event happens the webhook clones the repository and executes the build-run steps.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

There are several problems with this approach like maintaining the webhook code and not being able to scale easily. In the next post I will talk about using Github Actions to remove the need for writing our own webhook.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline inspired by Pieter Levels‚Äô workflow. We‚Äôll cover everything from server setup, writing webhooks, and automating deployment.

## Guide

In this guide we're going to setup a [CI/CD pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD){:target="\_blank"} that deploys a simple [MERN](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)>){:target="\_blank"} stack application on a server like Pieter Levels.

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Setup

In order to follow along with that application you will need to fork this repository: [https://github.com/prince-ao/the-most-complicated-button](https://github.com/prince-ao/the-most-complicated-button){:target="\_blank"}.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

You can also use a project of yours that you want to deploy, but I would highly recommend against that.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

VS Code is recommended for the [keybinding configuration](#icing-on-top-deploying-using-cmd--enter) part of the guide.

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Brief Introduction to Github Webhooks

Github Webhooks is a service that that sends a POST request to any URL specified whenever a specific action is taken; in our case a push to the repository.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

This is essentially the glue of the CI/CD pipeline.

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Launching and Configuring the Server

[Like Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/how-i-build-my-minimum-viable-products/){:target="\_blank"}, I will be using a linode cloud server.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

To start, sign up for [Linode](https://www.linode.com/){:target="\_blank"}, then create a new 'Linode' instance by following the platform's step-by-step instructions.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

I'm using a very simple spec for the ubuntu shared instance:

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

<img src="/assets/images/levels-linode.png">

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

If it's a new instance make sure to run

```bash
sudo apt update
suo apt upgrade
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

On the server you will need node and mongodb for the MERN application

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install 22
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

To install mongodb on the server, follow this simple tutorial: [install mongodb community edition on ubuntu](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Finally you will need python for writing the webhook route. Why python? Because it's simple. Python should be installed by default on ubuntu, you can test it by running

```bash
python3 -v
```

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Writing a Webhook

A webhook is simply a POST request.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

We will be using the flask backend framework

```bash
mkdir webhook && cd webhook

# creating virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# installing flask
pip3 install flask
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

After installing flask create a new file called `webhook.py` and paste this code into it.

```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
   payload = request.json

   print("payload:", payload)

   return jsonify({"message": "webhook received"}), 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Run the webhook in the background and set the log and error outputs to a separate file.

```bash
nohup python webhook.py > webhook.log 2> webhook.error &
```

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Adding the webhook to github

Now it's time to tell github about our webhook.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Read the error file and you should find the global endpoint for your server that

```bash
cat webhook.error
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

```md
- Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
- Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Running on http://173.x.x.x:5000 <- this is the global endpoint
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Paste the endpoint to github webhook interface under the repository settings for the project with a `/webhook` appended to it; the name of the route we created.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

<img src="/assets/images/levels-github.png">

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

When you push a small change, you should find a payload that looks like this in `webhook.log`.

```json
{
   "ref": "...",
   "before": "...",
   "after": "...",
   "repository": {...},
   .
   .
   .
}
```

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Building the Application with the Webhook

The new webhook code will clone the repository if the push was to the main branch and builds and runs it

```py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import subprocess
import os
import shutil

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
   payload = request.json

   if payload["ref"].split("/")[-1] == "main":
      repo = "the-most-complicated-button"
      repo_url = f"https://github.com/prince-ao/{repo}.git" # replace with your repo url

      if os.path.exists(f"./{repo}"):
         # some clean up
         shutil.rmtree(f"./{repo}")
         subprocess.run(["fuser", "-k", "3000/tcp"])
         subprocess.run(["fuser", "-k", "8080/tcp"])

      try:
         subprocess.run(["git", "clone", repo_url], check=True)

         subprocess.run(["npm", "install", f"./{repo}/backend"], check=True)

         with open(f"./{repo}/backend/backend.log", "w") as log_file:
            subprocess.Popen(["npm", "run", "start"],
            cwd=f"./{repo}/backend", stdout=log_file, stderr=log_file)

         subprocess.run(["npm", "install", f"./{repo}/frontend"], check=True)

         subprocess.run(["npm", "run", "build"], cwd=f"./{repo}/frontend")

         with open(f"./{repo}/frontend/frontend.log", "w") as log_file:
            subprocess.Popen(["npm", "run", "start"],
            cwd=f"./{repo}/frontend", stdout=log_file, stderr=log_file)

      except Exception as e:
         print("unable to complete clone and deploy", e)


   return jsonify({"message": "webhook received"}), 200


if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

The pattern in the code above works for the majority of application, but each application will need to tailor the specific build and run commands to whatever framework or methods they use.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Kill the webhook process and run this new webhook

```bash
kill -9 [process id]

nohup python webhook.py > webhook.log 2> webhook.error &
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

To find the process id run:

```bash
ps -e -o pid,command | grep "python webhook.py"
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

And... we're done! Just like that we have a working CI/CD pipeline similar to Pieter Levels'.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

To see the website visit the web server endpoint: `http://173.x.x.x:3000`

<div style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 60px;"></div>

### Supercharge Your Workflow: One-Key Deployment

In the podcast with Lex Friedman, Levels also mentions that [he deploy using CMD + Enter](https://youtu.be/oFtjKbXKqbg?t=9414). We will be using vs code to implement that feature.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

To do that you will need to create a new vs code task by creating a `.vscode` folder in the root of the folder and create the file `tasks.json` which contains

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "git add",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "git add .",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "git commit",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "git commit -m 'quick change'",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "dependsOn": "git add"
    },
    {
      "label": "git push",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "git push",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "problemMatcher": [],
      "dependsOn": "git commit"
    }
  ]
}
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Finally go to your `keybindings.json` file by pressing `Cmd + Shift + P` and typing "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)".

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Inside that file add this keybinding to the list of keybindings:

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+enter",
  "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
  "args": "Git Push",
  "when": "editorTextFocus"
}
```

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Make a change and push press `Cmd + Enter` and your change is deployed to production instantly.

## Conclusion

Setting up a CI/CD pipeline line like Pieter Levels is a quick and effective way to get code deployed to production.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Although the CI/CD pipeline works, it has its drawbacks.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

The most glaring problem is the maintenance of the webhook code; that's a piece of code that's hard to maintain because all the possible edge cases and it takes additional resources from the server.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

Another problem with the CI/CD pipeline is that that it won't work in every environment; if the server does not have, for example, node on it, the build and runs step will simply not run. Therefore if you want to scale horizontally, you will need to configure the new servers.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

There's is no testing in the pipeline, but that could be easily added after the build step in the webhook code.

<div style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;"></div>

While maintaining a custom webhook has its challenges, this setup is a powerful way to rapidly deploy projects like Pieter Levels. In the next post, we‚Äôll simplify this process even further with GitHub Actions, offering a more scalable and maintainable solution for fast CI/CD pipelines.
